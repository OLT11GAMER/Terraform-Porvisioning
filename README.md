Here's the updated README template for the "Terraform-Provisioning" repository, focusing on Google Cloud instead of AWS:

# Terraform-Provisioning

## Overview

This repository contains Terraform scripts and configuration files for provisioning infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The purpose is to automate the setup and management of cloud resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) methodologies.

## Features

- **GCP Infrastructure**: Provision and manage cloud resources on Google Cloud Platform.
- **Modular Terraform Code**: Utilize modular code structures for reusable and maintainable configurations.
- **Version Control**: Track changes to infrastructure configurations over time using Git.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (v0.12 or higher)
- Google Cloud account with appropriate permissions
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) installed and configured

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OLT11GAMER/Terraform-Porvisioning.git
   cd Terraform-Porvisioning
   ```

2. **Initialize the Terraform workspace**:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Configure GCP credentials**:

   Ensure you have your GCP credentials set up correctly, usually via a JSON key file:

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/your/credentials.json"
   ```

4. **Review and modify the configuration files** as needed for your specific requirements.

### Usage

To deploy the infrastructure on GCP, use the following command:

```bash
terraform apply
```

To remove the provisioned infrastructure, use:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

### Configuration

The configuration files include:

- `main.tf`: Main configuration file containing the resource definitions.
- `variables.tf`: Definitions of variables used in the project.
- `outputs.tf`: Outputs of the Terraform execution.

You can customize these files to suit your projectâ€™s specific needs, such as defining your GCP project ID, regions, and other parameters.
